      HELLO THERE!
    </p>
    <p class="font-body">
      My name is Sydney and I am an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer.  I am studied in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering with a background in medical device research.  Whereas software engineering had been a side project, I am hoping to make a career change and work full time as a Software Engineer or Computer Programmer.
      <br><br>
      I recently (Mar 2020) completed the Le Wagon coding bootcamp in Bali, Indonesia.  The 9-week intensive bootcamp included: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES2015, SQL Databases, git/GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails.  Additionally, two prototype applications were designed, implemented and shipped to production (see <a href="#portfolio" class="link">PORTFOLIO SECTION</a> for more information).
      <br><br>
      Though displaced due to pandemic-related circumstances, I am continuing to learn new languages (React; Redux) and work on a number of personal and collaborative projects.
