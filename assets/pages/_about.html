      <br><br>
      Recently (Mar 2020) completed the Le Wagon coding bootcamp in Bali, Indonesia.  The 9-week intensive bootcamp included: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES2015, SQL Databases, git/GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails.  Additionally, two prototype applications were designed, implemented and shipped to production (see <a href="#portfolio" class="link">PORTFOLIO SECTION</a> for more information).

      Though displaced due to pandemic-related circumstances, I am continuing to learn new languages (React; Redux) and work on a number of personal and collaborative projects.
