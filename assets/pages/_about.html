      Recently, I attended and completed the Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp in Bali, Indonesia where I learned a variety of font- and back-end languages over the course of 9-weeks.  Since completing the bootcamp, I have been continuing to improve and expand my coding skills through a number of collaborative and personal projects.
